    <h1>The character art of Jungle Dunk</h1>
<h2>Making stylized characters for a fast-paced game</h2>
<h3>Concept • Model • Texture</h3>
<p><em>Jungle Dunk</em> is a 4vs4 platformer game in which teamplay is key to score the most fruits in the volcano.<br>
This was my and my team's graduation project. It has been made in <em>Unreal Engine 4</em>.</p>
<p class="text-sm mb-7">
I was also the animator for this project! You can learn more about it <a href="../../../animations/anim-jdb">here</a>.
</p>
<p>For all these characters, I did my best to stay as close to as possible to the 2D concept as to keep their original appeal.</p>
<p>The design of these monkey characters had a lot of iterations and were a team effort. I refined the final design shown here. To give the most personnality to the characters without putting in too much complexity, I designed them with <em>interchangeable face parts</em> in mind. It was the most suitable solution for the project as the character move a lot and I was the only animator and character artist on the project. For these reasons full facial rig would have been overkill and possibly more limited for how far I could push the expressions and visual simplifications.</p>

<p>Since the bird king was to be seen from further away, I gave it a pretty low poly count considering its size.
