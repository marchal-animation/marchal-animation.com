# The 2D animation of Go Go Magnet!

## Is it a sprint or a marathon? Giving life to a humongous cast

### Rigging • Skinning • Animation

_Go Go Magnet!_ is a fishing adventure mobile game made by game studio _OhBibi!_,  
It is available to download from *Google play store* and Apple's *App store*.

_Go Go Magnet!_ is a game in which the player has a lot of crew member to collect and equip on their ship. I rigged skinned and animated **over one hundred** characters using *Spine2D* for the game. During that time I was in close collaboration with the 2D artists and made a project-specific workflow documentation for both the artists and new animators on the project to streamline collaboration.

  Since the appeal of the collection was focused on **quantity** and **individuality**, my goal was to focus on **humor** and **expressivity** in my animations.<br/>
  The rhythm of production was very fast-paced, I was rigging, skinning, animating and setting up in *Unity* 2 to 3 characters per day.

  Here are some characters I animated as seen in game menus.

Beside the characters, I got to animate the *intro of the game*.<br/> I discussed how to make it possible with the director/programmer and helped the 2D artist cut and add small details to the art (added some other sprites for the eyes, mouths, splashes of water...). Each panel has a start animation followed by a looping animation to allow the panel to stay animated on screen, waiting for the interaction of the player.

Most of my Spine2D work has been for _Go Go Magnet!_,  but I also did some for <a href="../anim-beast/#beast_spine">BEAST!</a>
