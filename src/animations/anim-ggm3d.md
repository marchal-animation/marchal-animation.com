# The 3D animation of Go Go Magnet

## Staging and blending styles

### Rigging • Skinning • Animation

_Go Go Magnet!_ is a fishing adventure mobile game made by game studio _OhBibi!_,  
It is available to download from *Google play store* and Apple's *App store*.


Companions are creatures hatching from eggs. They each have their own power to help you in your adventures. 
Since the companions are very different from one another, cartoony and far from humanoids, I made the rigs from scratch in *Blender*. <br/>
I tried to imitate some of the animation choices we had for the 2D characters of the game to help the styles blend with each other more.

Throughout your adventures, you'll meet the merchant. I was responsible for the animation of his boat and added a socket attached to an animated bone to make the 2D animation appear and blend with the rest.

This is the gachapon Island, where you can occasionnally get some random goodies.<br/>
I've been part of its production since the very beggining so I was able to offer my ideas for the design, 
work closely with the 3D artist and draft storyboards and mockups to show the team and get feedbacks before making the final animation!

While I don't have the mockups for this one anymore...I still have the ones from the gold-stealing mechanic! Each versions got iterations through feedbacks from the team.
