# Bringing to life characters for Frag

## Working on new content on an already etablished game

### Skinning â€¢ Animation

_Frag_ is a first and third person shooter game for mobile made by game studio _OhBibi!_,  
It is available to download from *Google play store*, Apple's *App store* and *Nintendo Switch*'s store. <br/> <br/>

I was responsible for several characters skinning, animation and animator controllers. Since the characters all use the same humanoid rig for the most parts, the main locomotion and shoot animations were already made by other animators. My work on this project was usually to add menu animations and special move animations, which are all unique, to the new characters, as well as making ajustments in the already made animator controllers.

Here is a compilation of some of my menu animation work for *Frag*.
